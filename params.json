{"name":"Audjustable","tagline":"A fast and extensible audio streamer for iOS and OSX with support for gapless playback and custom (non-HTTP) sources","body":"### Audjustable Audio Streamer\r\n\r\n[Homepage](http://tumtumtum.github.com/audjustable)\r\n\r\nAudjustable is audio streaming class for iOS and OSX.  Audjustable uses CoreAudio to decompress and playback audio whilst providing a clean and simple object-oriented API.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Simple OOP API\r\n* Easy to read source\r\n* Adjustable audio buffering\r\n* Buffered and gapless playback\r\n* Easy to implement audio data sources (HTTP and local file system DataSources provided)\r\n* Easy to extend DataSource to support adaptive buffering, encryption etc\r\n* Optimised for low CPU/battery usage\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nDownload the [source](https://github.com/tumtumtum/audjustable/zipball/master) which includes a simple audio player project that streams audio over HTTP or locally using the `HttpDataSource` or `LocalFileDataSource\" classes respectively.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to integrate the AudioPlayer directly into your project you only need to copy the files inside the `/Audjustable/Classes/AudioPlayer` [directory](https://github.com/tumtumtum/audjustable/tree/master/Audjustable/Classes/AudioPlayer) into your project.\r\n\r\n## Code\r\n\r\nThere are two main classes.  The `DataSource` class which is the abstract base class for the various compressed audio data sources (HTTP, local file are provided). The `AudioPlayer` class manages and renders audio from a queue DataSources.\r\n\r\n```objective-c\r\n\r\n// Create AudioPlayer\r\n\r\nAudioPlayer* audioPlayer = [[AudioPlayer alloc] init];\r\naudioPlayer.delegate = self;\r\n\r\n// Queue on a URL to play.  Each queue item has a unique ID (item1) that to identify the related file in delegate callbacks\r\n\r\n[audioPlayer setDataSource:[audioPlayer dataSourceFromURL:@\"https://github.com/downloads/tumtumtum/audjustable/sample.m4a\"] withQueueItemId:@\"item1\"];\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCopyright 2012, Thong Nguyen (@tumtumtum)","note":"Don't delete this file!
